## TODO

- [ ] Win streaks
- [ ] Experiment with more models
- [ ] Homepage should have "stacked" ranking like the broadcast page does (logo/name on top of bar instead of horizontally aligned)

## TODO Bugfixes

- [x] Text wrapping on long single-strings
- [x] Stream crashing on fresh deployment (because the ffmpeg pipe dies, we should handle this in the ffmpeg script)
- [x] Throttle view count updates
